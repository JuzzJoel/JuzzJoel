- 👋 Hi, I’m @JuzzJoel# 

I'm curious and a young Nigerian Software Engineer in training, grinding code and crafting dreams. Yoruba by blood, builder by nature. Currently navigating the world of **JavaScript** and **Python**, one bug at a time.
- 👀 I’m interested in **web development**, **open source**, and using tech to solve real-world problems — especially in Africa.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **JavaScript**, **Python**, and slowly diving into **React** and **Node.js**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly open source projects, or anything that’ll stretch my skills and brain cells.
